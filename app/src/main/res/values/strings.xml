    <string name="rulestext"><font color='#000000'>This application was created to pass the course project on the discipline "Mobile applications".
        This application implemented a game called "Reversi".</font>\n
        \n<font color='#c60d0d'>Basic Rules:</font>\n
        <font color='#000000'>Each reversi piece has a black side and a white side. On your turn, you place one piece on the board with your color facing up.
        You must place the piece so that an opponent\'s piece, or a row of opponent\'s pieces, is flanked by your pieces.
            All of the opponent\'s pieces between your pieces are then turned over to become your color.</font>\n
        \n<font color='#c60d0d'>Aim of the game:</font>\n
        <font color='#000000'>The object of the game is to own more pieces than your opponent when the game is over. The game is over when neither player has a move.
            Usually, this means the board is full.</font>\n
        \n<font color='#c60d0d'>Start of the game:</font>\n
        <font color='#000000'>The game is started in the position shown below on a reversi board consisting of 64 squares in an 8x8 grid.</font>\n
        \n<font color='#c60d0d'>End of the game:</font>\n
        <font color='#000000'>The game ends when one player wins, by making his color dominant on the board.</font>
